I've created a website for my students to enable better communication, provide access to a knowledge base, and track their progress through interactive tests.
Some functionalities below.

Secure user registration and login system
Role-based access (teachers and students)
Teacher dashboard for creating and managing newsletter and tests
Automated test evaluation and detailed result statistics
Knowledge resources tab
Email notifications for new tests
Responsive and user-friendly interface using Bootstrap
